# HealthCare-Chat-Agent
Project Name: AI-Powered Medical Care Chat Agent

Problem Statement:
Healthcare providers and patients often struggle with accessing accurate and timely medical information. Traditional support systems may lead to delays in response, difficulty in retrieving essential medical guidelines, and inconsistent information delivery. There is a need for an AI-powered solution that can provide reliable, real-time medical guidance based on trusted healthcare documentation and sources.

Solution:
This project introduces an AI-driven medical care chat agent that utilizes document-based retrieval and NLP models to deliver precise and context-aware responses. By processing and indexing medical guidelines, research papers, FAQs, and patient care documentation, the chat agent ensures informed and effective medical support. The system employs FAISS for efficient document retrieval and advanced LLMs for generating high-quality medical responses, significantly improving accessibility to critical healthcare knowledge.

Description:
This AI-driven medical care chat agent is designed for healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers. It processes PDFs, DOCX, and TXT files containing medical literature, treatment protocols, and health guidelines to provide meaningful responses. The backend is built using Python (Flask), while the frontend utilizes Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.

Features:

Document-based medical support chat agent.

AI-driven response generation using NLP models.

Uses FAISS for efficient document retrieval.

Streamlit-based UI for an intuitive user experience.

Supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT file processing.

Utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for medical response generation.

Provides trusted medical information from uploaded resources.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Web Framework: Flask, Streamlit

NLP Models:

SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for text embedding and semantic search.

Hugging Face Transformers (Flan-T5) for text-to-text generation and response formulation.

Document Handling: PyPDF2, docx2txt

Vector Search: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)

How It Works:

Uploaded medical documents are processed and chunked into smaller text segments.

Each text segment is converted into vector embeddings using SentenceTransformers.

FAISS indexes these embeddings for efficient retrieval.

When a user submits a query, the system converts it into an embedding and searches FAISS for the most relevant medical document chunks.

The retrieved text chunks are combined and passed to the Flan-T5 model, which generates a medically relevant and contextually appropriate response.

Steps to Implement:

Set Up the Project: Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.

Create a Virtual Environment: Set up a Python virtual environment and activate it.

Install Dependencies: Install all required libraries and frameworks.

Index Documents: Upload and process medical documents to build the FAISS index.

Run the Application: Start the chat agent and interact via the Streamlit interface.

Test and Deploy: Ensure the system functions as expected and deploy it on a secure server if needed.

Installation Steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/MedicalCare-Chatbot.git
cd MedicalCare-Chatbot

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the chat agent application:

streamlit run app.py

Open the chat agent in a browser:
The chat agent UI will open automatically via Streamlit.

File Structure:

Usage:

Upload medical documents (treatment guidelines, research papers, healthcare protocols).

Ask the chat agent medical-related questions based on uploaded documents.

The chat agent retrieves the most relevant response using FAISS and NLP models.

Provides AI-assisted support for medical professionals and patients.
